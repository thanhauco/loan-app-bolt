### Confidence Calculation Framework

All document validation follows SBA SOP 50 10 8 requirements with binary pass/fail criteria rather than arbitrary scoring:

#### Business License Validation
- **SBA Requirement**: Current, valid business license per SOP 50 10 8 Chapter 3
- **Validation Logic**:
  - REQUIRED: License number, business name, expiration date, issuing authority
  - CRITICAL: Must not be expired (automatic fail if expired)
  - PASS THRESHOLD: All required fields present + current status
  - CONFIDENCE: Based on field completeness and date validity

#### Tax Returns Validation (SOP 50 10 8 Chapter 4)
- **SBA Requirement**: 3 complete years, signed and dated
- **Validation Logic**:
  - REQUIRED: Form identification (1040, 1120, 1120S, 1065), signature, date
  - CRITICAL: Must be signed (automatic fail if unsigned)
  - CRITICAL: Must be within 3-year requirement
  - PASS THRESHOLD: Signed + complete + within timeframe
  - CONFIDENCE: Based on completeness and signature verification

#### Financial Statements Validation (SOP 50 10 8 Chapter 4)
- **SBA Requirement**: Current financial statements with key metrics
- **Validation Logic**:
  - REQUIRED: Balance sheet data, P&L data, statement date

  - CRITICAL: Must be signed (automatic fail if unsigned)
  - PASS THRESHOLD: Complete + signed + current
  - CONFIDENCE: Based on completeness and currency

#### Business Plan Validation (SOP 50 10 8 Chapter 6)

- **Validation Logic**:
  - REQUIRED SECTIONS (per SOP 50 10 8):
    - Executive Summary
    - Business Description
    - Management Team/Experience
    - Financial Projections (3-year minimum)
    - Use of Funds Statement
    - Repayment Analysis
  - CRITICAL: Financial projections are MANDATORY, not optional

  - REQUIRED: Total loan amount, category breakdown, specific amounts
  - REQUIRED CATEGORIES: Working capital, equipment, real estate, debt refinancing
  - CRITICAL: Amounts must add up to total loan request
  - PASS THRESHOLD: Detailed breakdown + amounts balance
  - CONFIDENCE: Based on detail level and mathematical accuracy

- **Validation Logic**:

  - REQUIRED: State certification or filing stamp
  - PASS THRESHOLD: Complete state filing information
  - CONFIDENCE: Based on official documentation completeness

### Overall Validation Thresholds

- **INVALID**: Missing critical requirements OR confidence <70% OR has compliance issues
- **PENDING**: Document processing in progress

### SBA SOP 50 10 8 Compliance Notes

1. **No Exceptions**: SBA regulations are federal requirements - no "good enough" standards
2. **Binary Requirements**: Documents either meet SBA standards or they don't
3. **Critical vs. Preferred**: Some items are required (signature, dates), others are preferred (CPA preparation)
4. **Timeframe Sensitivity**: Many documents have specific currency requirements (90 days, 12 months, 3 years)
5. **Completeness Standard**: Partial documents don't meet SBA standards
